# Data-UserRepo Agent Diary

- Created Nx library `libs/data-access/user-data` (project: `data-access-user-data`).
- Implemented repo interfaces per `.ai/pokedex-interfaces.md`:
  - SquadRepo, BoxRepo, DexRepo, ProfileRepo
- Built an in-memory adapter `InMemoryUserData` with read-your-writes semantics.
- Implemented `InMemoryMigrationService` for guestâ†’user merging (squad, box, dex flags).
- Added unit tests for repos and migration; tests green via `pnpm nx test data-access-user-data`.
- Resolved Nx project name conflicts and updated `tsconfig.base.json` paths.
- Branch synced with `origin/main` per routine.
