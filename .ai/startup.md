# Project goal

The project will be a portfolio and showcase composed by a main nx monorepo with multiple projects and libraries, some working together, some standalone.

## Startup

- i want to use pnpm as package manager, configure it as first thing
- create a nx monorepo, let's keep it empty for now
- update the .gitignore with nx specific rules
- update the AGENTS.md file with some generic rules on using nx and pnpm
- update the AGENTS.md to use always pnpm to run scripts, and nx specific command format

## How to work

- create a plan with a step by step approach
- explain to me the plan
- break down the plan into smaller steps, always perform one step at a time
- after each step, explain to me what you have done and what you will do next
- after each step, ask me if you can proceed with the next step
